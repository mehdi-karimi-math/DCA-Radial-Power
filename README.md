# DCA-Radial-Power
This code implements a distributed consensus algorithm (DCA) for optimial power flow (OPF) problems using a special *Radial Partitioning*. The code uses the python modelling package for optimization Pyomo, using the solver Ipopt. 

Some case instances from the MATPOWER library that are trasformed into Pyomo data format are given.
